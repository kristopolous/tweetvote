# Tweet Vote
## A Greasemonkey plugin for pruning twitter followers

Twitter content only stays interesting if you constantly follow
new people and unfollow users that start flooding your feed with
low quality content.

However it can be hard to keep track of track record of each user and so one ends up doing a trigger finger and unfollowing people on the first low quality tweet.

This helps change that.  By appending a voting system after each tweet,
you can privately keep track of how many down and upvotes you have given
to the quality of each users tweets.

Then you can use whatever threshold score you want to draw an assessment
of what kind of action you'd like to take.
